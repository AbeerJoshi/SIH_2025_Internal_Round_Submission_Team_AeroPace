                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>It all began with a powerful idea: what if a simple web-based survey could accurately identify an precaution for water-borne diseases and provide immediate, life-saving advice? This concept became the first step in our journey to build the <strong>HealthPool Ecosystem</strong>.</p>
                <p>We saw a critical need to translate public health knowledge into a personal, easy-to-understand format. Our goal was to move beyond generic warnings and offer personalized guidance that people could act on instantly. From this initial vision, we developed our flagship toolâ€”a smart, intuitive survey that serves as a first line of defense against preventable diseases.</p>
